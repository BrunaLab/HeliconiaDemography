## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

The simplest way to explore the text, code and data is to click on
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/BrunaLab/HeliconiaDemography/master?urlpath=rstudio)
to open an instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the
compendium files ready to work with. Binder uses rocker-project.org
Docker images to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational
environment. These Docker images can also be used locally.

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping:

-   open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio
-   something about `renv`
-   something about `targets::tar_make()` and
    `targets::tar_visnetwork()`
    <!-- -   run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). -->
    <!-- -   finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.docx`, or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd")` in the R console -->
